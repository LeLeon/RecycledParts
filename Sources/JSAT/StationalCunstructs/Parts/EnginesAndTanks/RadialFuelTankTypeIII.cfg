	description = Jeb always wanted a raially attachable fuel tank that would look awesome with most of the engines , after mark 1 and 2, jeb bothered every one about how bad of a design mark 2 was for planes, he insisted to widen it the other way! After nagging people and bothering many engineers and eating tons of snaks, here we have it!
