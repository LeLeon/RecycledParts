***version 1.0

-modified lines in .cfg are marked with //************************

Part lightbulb:

- imported model to blender
- cleaned things:
	- cleaned mesh etc... due to import (Blender .mu import/export addon v1.0.0)
	- rotated objects to be ready for Unity without rotating them again.
	- merged 2 colliders for performance. 
	- fixed a mesh bug where the piston could be seen (a bit) outside the bulb during gimbaling.
	- fixed texture on piston showing the trick of the fake piston not moving (dark "shadow" texture).
- separated emissive animation in 2 (and so cut/past a piece of the bottom of the bulb mesh to the nozzles):
	- 1 linked to the throttle for nozzles: FXModuleAnimateThrottle
	- 1 linked to the part internal temperature (bulb): ModuleAnimateHeat
-copied and modified cfg in LightBulb-2.cfg
-reworked the too dark/grey textures for fairings.


Fx (effect for engines):

- converted plasma.mbm texture to .dds


todo: (suggest)

-remove "surface attachable": allowSrfAttach in attachRules. 
(or i cant set the colliders to be not attachable in unity for fairing and lower bulb)
-other engines?
-remove the 6 colliders for fairings? (performance)
-remove ressource "IntakeAtm" patch, dependancy to "Community Resource Pack" containing it instead?
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007-13-community-resource-pack/
or use "IntakeAir" with "checkForOxygen = false" ?
- merge the module manager patches directly into the part config.
- tweak parameters: increase heat generation or lower heat resistance (we have stock radiators now) and trust damage (power and distance).

-enjoy :p
