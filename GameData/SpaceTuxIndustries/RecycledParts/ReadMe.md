Packaging and Installing

Each of these mods is a folder inside the SpaceTuxIndustries/RecycledParts folder.  They are standalone, meaning that each can be removed without any impact to any of the other mods

There are a few ships packaged along with the mod,these are in the Ships/SPH folder

To install, copy the GameData AND Ships folders into the main KSP folder.  The files in the GameData should be merged with the current GameData folder, and the files in the Ships folder will be merged with the files in the stock Ships folder

Regarding CKAN, there will be an overall RecycledPart entry which will install everything, and then there will be individual entries for each of them, so you will be able to install each by itself without all the others

===========================================================================================

I am extremely grateful to the following people who provided invaluable assistance in updating some of the parts:

Forum user @Skalou
	Skalou redid the models for the Atomic Age engines, to fix both the gimboling AND the nozzel on
	the end of the Nuclear Jet engine.  I don't know what he did, but it works now.  He also added some new emissions to the jet

@Skalou came through again with fixing the model for the Quadpoodle engine 

Forum user @theonegalen
	Theonegalen looked at one of the IVAs to assure me that it was working well, and pointed out a dependency which I was not aware of

Forum user @Shadowmage
	Shadowmage redid the wheels for the Farscape mod

If I missed anyone, plesae let me know and I'll get this updated ASAP
