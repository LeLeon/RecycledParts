		// ********** All Parts:

		#LOC.ftnm_manufacturer = Nucleonics Ltd.
		
		// ********** Part: bl40n

		#LOC.ftnm_bl40n_description = Advanced, compact spherical outflow reactor design. The BL-40-N is designed for multiple mission roles, and is designed to be used alone or in clusters.
		#LOC.ftnm_bl40n_title = BL-40-N Nuclear Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn180

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn180_description = The FTmN 180 is the pinnacle of classic reactor design. The engine was designed with modularity in mind, and Nucleotronics are hard at work developing thrust augmentation & power-generating turbine packs for all your future modular nuclear rocket system needs.
		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn180_title = FTmN 180 Nuclear Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn400

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn400_description = The goal of this engine is to provide something enormous to stick on the end of very big spacecraft. It houses a reactor capable of powering (or in unfortunate cases, rendering uninhabitable) a small city, has doubled-up turbopumps to aid in looking impressive and an exhaust manifold that may have been chosen simply because it looks like one off an especially large rocket engine.
		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn400_title = FTmN 400 Nuclear Rocket

		// ********** Part: ftmn80

		#LOC.ftnm_ftmn80_description = The Fission Thermal Nuclear Rocket 80 was the fist in a long line of nuclear engines. Notable features include the worryingly lacking radiation shielding and the core design optimised for usage of typical liquid fuel, offering great thrust with modest Isp.
