	// ********** All Parts:
		#LOC.rsc_manufacturer = R&S Capsuledyne

	// ********** Part: Size3SASBatt

		#LOC.rsc_Size3SASBatt_description = Bigger is always better, and R&S Capsuledyne didn't want to over do it - so the battery only holds 8000 units of electricity. To make up for this, R&S's finest engineers surrounded the battery with a big reaction wheel - leading to a very capable package.
		#LOC.rsc_Size3SASBatt_tags = capacitor cell charge e/c elect pack power volt watt cmg command control fly gyro moment react stab steer torque
		#LOC.rsc_Size3SASBatt_title = R&S Z-8K Rechargeable Battery Reaction Wheel Module

		// ********** Part: Size3TinyTank

		#LOC.rsc_Size3TinyTank_description = For such a large fuel tank, this is a pretty small fuel tank. It works best for large diameter upper stages. Trust us.
		#LOC.rsc_Size3TinyTank_title = R&S Capsuledyne S3-1800 Tank

		// ********** Part: stackSeparatorHuge

		#LOC.rsc_stackSeparatorHuge_description = After running out of non-explosive bolts, the R&S Capsuledyne engineers realized something: why not make it detach from *both* sides?

		#LOC.rsc_stackSeparatorHuge_title = XLG-3 Stack Separator

		// ********** Part: TaurusHCV

		#LOC.rsc_TaurusHCV_description = Just weeks after plans for a very large capsule disappeared from Rockomax labs, R&S Capsuledyne burst into the market with this staggering and original innovation. Lawsuit pending.
		#LOC.rsc_TaurusHCV_title = Taurus HCV

		// ********** Part: TaurusHeatshield

		#LOC.rsc_TaurusHeatshield_description = After test pilots complained that the Taurus didn't look "spacey enough", the R&S team whipped up this "heatshield" to make them shut up. It also keeps the capsule safe during reentry, or whatever.
		#LOC.rsc_TaurusHeatshield_title = Taurus HCV Heat Shield
