		// ********** All Parts:
		#LOC.aa_atomicage_manufacturer = PorkWorks
	
		// ********** Part: nuclearEngineKANDL

		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineKANDL_description = Take an RTG, and pump fuel through the hot radioactive core into a nozzle. The result is a very small nuclear rocket engine. Thrust is low, but probes won't mind. Waste Heat Rating: 400
		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineKANDL_title = LV-RTG "KANDL" SKALOU.v2 Radioisotope Rocket

		// ********** Part: nuclearEngineLANTR

		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineLANTR_description = A more compact and lightweight Nuclear Thermal Rocket design. Hot Feature: LOX-Augmented Afterburner mode - Oxidizer is injected directly into the nozzle where it violently reacts with the superheated plasma exhaust and causes a massive increase in thrust, at the cost of a lower ISP. Waste Heat Rating: 250/500
		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineLANTR_title = LV-Nx "LANTRN" Atomic Engine

		// ********** Part: nuclearEngineLightbulb

		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineLightbulb_description = The Closed Cycle Gas-Core design overcomes the limits of Solid Core NTR's by deliberately letting the Reactor melt and vaporize, reaching much higher core temperatures and exhaust velocities, which grants this rocket an enoromous ISP of 1500s. No radioactive material leaves the engine though, the vaporized nuclear hellfire is safely confined within seven astonishingly fragile transparent quartz bulbs, which let most of the thermal radiation through to the propellant and are the reason for its lovely name. A sophisticated system of active cooling and a steady vortex stream of inert gas around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevent the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing. Actually yes, it does sound kind of scary, but as with everything in life, the coolness of things is proportional to their danger. Waste Heat Rating: 2000
		#LOC.aa_nuclearEngineLightbulb_title = CCGC-7.2 "Lightbulb" Atomic Engine

		// ********** Part: NuclearJetEngine

		#LOC.aa_NuclearJetEngine_description = Similiar to a chemical Turbojet, except the cumbustion chamber has been replaced by a nuclear reactor heating the air and driving the turbine. Since it does not rely on chemical combustion, flight time is unlimited and the engine will work in oxygenless atmospheres. The only downside is the mass added by the heavy reactor shielding.
		#LOC.aa_NuclearJetEngine_tags = active atom efficient engine (torch nuclear nuke propuls radio reactor turbo jet
		#LOC.aa_NuclearJetEngine_title = LV-Tx "Torch" Skalou-v5 Atomic Turbojet

		// ********** Part: radiatorRadialLarge

		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialLarge_description = High performance titanium radiator with molten lithium active cooling cycle. Highly temperature resistant and extremely durable. Power Rating: 300
		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialLarge_title = Wrap-Around Radiator (3.75m)

		// ********** Part: radiatorRadialMedium

		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialMedium_description = High performance titanium radiator with molten lithium active cooling cycle. Highly temperature resistant and extremely durable. Power Rating: 125
		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialMedium_title = Wrap-Around Radiator (2.5m)

		// ********** Part: radiatorRadialSmall

		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialSmall_description = High performance titanium radiator with molten lithium active cooling cycle. Highly temperature resistant and extremely durable. Power Rating: 60
		#LOC.aa_radiatorRadialSmall_title = Wrap-Around Radiator (1.25m)
