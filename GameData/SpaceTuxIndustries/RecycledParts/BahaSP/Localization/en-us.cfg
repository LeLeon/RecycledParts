		// ********** Part: bahaMk2LightningCockpit

		#LOC_bahaMk2LightningCockpit_description = This is a two-man cockpit made to fit well with the Mk2 parts from B9 Aerospace. Inspired by the F-35 and F-22, the module has built-in air intakes, a fully loaded IVA and a huge glass canopy. You'll be able to clearly see all around you. Just hope it can withstand the vacuum of space. Accessible through the MFDs are a forward, landing, bombing, and rear view camera.
